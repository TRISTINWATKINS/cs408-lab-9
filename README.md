# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

Project Overview

This project is an interactive bouncing balls simulation implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The program demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts by using a Shape base class from which both Ball and EvilCircle inherit.

Balls move and bounce off the edges of the screen.

Balls change color when they collide with each other.

A user-controlled EvilCircle moves around the screen using WASD keys to “eat” balls.

## Sources and Credits

TODO: You must credit the sources and authors of any code, libraries, or other
assets you use in your project. If you leave this section blank, your project
will be considered in violation of the Academic Honesty policy unless you truly
created everything from scratch with no outside help. If you need to use a
source that you cannot credit (e.g. a classmate's work), you must get explicit
permission from your instructor.

A simple bulleted list below is sufficient. For example:


Sources I used

- Past HW Assiments from old Shane classes.
- Small bit of chat GPT, in order to figure out how to get the ball to be smooth
- Google, For how to style the CSS, color questions and font questions
